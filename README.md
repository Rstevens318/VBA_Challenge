# VBA_Challenge


With This challenge we were asked to analyze stock data for 3 years. 

We have created a macro that will successfully loop through our data set and populate four(4) new columns with
each Ticker, the Yearly Change of that Ticker (with conditional formatting for Green >= 0 and Red <0), Percent change of that Ticker (with conditional formatting that enables the column for percent), and Total Stock Volume of that Ticker.

Once this has been achieved we will loop through our new data set to provide the greatest percent increase, decrease, total volume, and the Ticker associated with each for the data set 

Since we have multiple spreadsheets the macro needs to be able to run across all spreadsheets simultaneously. 

Provided are screenshots of the outcome and code used to run the macro on single and multiple spreadsheets.
